# JFLAP-projects
In this project, I constructed a turing machine with the help of JFLAP tool. The goal of the project was to create a visual representation of different formal automata languages.
JFLAP (Java Formal Languages and Automata Package) is a software tool developed at the University of Arizona. It provides a user-friendly interface for experimenting with various topics in formal languages and automata theory.
All in, this project provided me an opportunity to learn about JFLAP and gain a more detailed and fun insight into the world of automata.
